=begin 
  In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 12, and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.
